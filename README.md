# Eye
Using Javascript, CSS, and HTML, we have two eye-like elements to track the mouse cursor's movement on the webpage, creating a subtle interactive effect. This feature adds a touch of interactivity and visual interest to the interface.

Future Improvements:
    -We can implement feature B to add new functionality like blinking for instance.
    -We can improve user interface on mobile for better user experience.
